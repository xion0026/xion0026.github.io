        </article>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Yingxin Xiong</strong> and I’m a level 1 student in the Interactive Media Design program. I was a makeup artist for more than 7 years in China at the same time I was a consultant worked in a high school. This 
            program is a newly area for me and I love design.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a foodie and I love exercise like hiking, camping, clumbing on the weekend with my friends. In the future, I wish I will move to <em>Canada</em> and be a web designer. But now I’m living in China, so the timing is hard 
            to go to class.
        </p>
